# Besti-ez Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Besti-ez application. It covers different types of tests, tools and frameworks used, and instructions on how to run each type of test.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Tools**: Jest (Frontend), pytest (Backend)
- **Location**:
  - Frontend: `/home/ubuntu/besti-ez/frontend/src/__tests__/unit/`
  - Backend: `/home/ubuntu/besti-ez/backend/tests/unit/`
- **How to run**:
  - Frontend: `npm run test:unit`
  - Backend: `pytest tests/unit`

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Test interaction between components and external services (e.g., WebSocket)
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, pytest
- **Location**:
  - Frontend: `/home/ubuntu/besti-ez/frontend/src/__tests__/integration/`
  - Backend: `/home/ubuntu/besti-ez/backend/tests/integration/`
- **How to run**:
  - Frontend: `npm run test:integration`
  - Backend: `pytest tests/integration`

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Purpose**: Test the entire application flow from user perspective
- **Tools**: Cypress (to be implemented)
- **Location**: `/home/ubuntu/besti-ez/frontend/cypress/`
- **How to run**: `npm run test:e2e` (to be implemented)

### 4. Performance Tests
- **Purpose**: Evaluate system performance under load
- **Tools**: To be determined
- **Location**: To be implemented
- **How to run**: To be implemented

## Testing Tools and Frameworks

### Frontend
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Testing utility for React components
- **Chakra UI**: UI component library with built-in accessibility features
- **jest-websocket-mock**: WebSocket mocking for Jest tests

### Backend
- **pytest**: Python testing framework
- **FastAPI TestClient**: For testing FastAPI routes

## Running Tests

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run end-to-end tests (to be implemented)
npm run test:e2e

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=app
```

## Continuous Integration
- To be implemented: Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing on pull requests and merges to main branch

## Best Practices
1. Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
2. Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical components
3. Keep tests independent and idempotent
4. Use meaningful test descriptions
5. Regularly review and update tests as the application evolves

## Future Improvements
1. Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress
2. Set up performance testing suite
3. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
4. Expand test coverage for backend API endpoints
5. Implement snapshot testing for UI components

This testing strategy is a living document and should be updated as the project evolves and new testing needs are identified.
